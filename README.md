# Introduction to Data Analysis with Python

# Course Objectives
The goal of this course is to share programming knowledge and practical skills. The topics and problems covered are directly related to work I have done as a data analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By the end of the course, you should be able to **open Python** and Jupyter Notebooks; **ingest data** from various sources, including Excel files, CSV, PDF, HTML, and Zip files; **wrangle data** using Python Pandas library as well as core built in libraries; perform summary *analysis* and *visualizations* on resulting data.

This course will prepare you to write "research code": you will be able to open Python, ingest data, wrangle and query the data, analyze it to answer specific questions, and share those answers with others. I hope that through this course it will become clear how Python can be used to make many routine data analysis tasks easier--leaving you with time to do other things, like lift weights.
