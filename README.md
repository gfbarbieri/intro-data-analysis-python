# Introduction to Data Analysis with Python

## Course Objectives
The goal of this short-course is to share programming knowledge and practical skills. The topics and problems covered are directly related to work I have done as a data analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By the end of the course, you should be able to **open Python** and Jupyter Notebooks; **ingest data** from various sources, including Excel files, CSV, PDF, HTML, and Zip files; **wrangle data** using Python Pandas library as well as core built-in libraries; perform summary **analysis** and **visualizations**.

This course is designed for Python novices, but it would be helpful if users have had experience solving problems typical of the data analyst. This course will prepare you to write "research code": you will be able to open Python, ingest, wrangle, and query the data, analyze it to answer specific questions, and share those answers with others. I hope that through this course it will become clear how Python can be used to make many routine data analysis tasks easier--leaving you with time to do other things, like lift weights.

## Course Outline
Part I: Introduction to the Data Analysis Pipeline  
Part II: Python Primer with Jupyter Notebooks  
Part III: Ingestion and Data Sources  
Part IV: Wrangling Data  
Part V: Analysis & Visualizations  
Part VI: Output and Sharing  

## Course Prerequisites: Installing Python with Anaconda
The course will work exclusive with Python 3 in Jupyter Notebooks, which can all be very easily downloaded from Anaconda. If you are a novice, and *especially for Windows users*, follow the steps below to get started with Python. Do not deviate from them or get hung up by the internet's many discussions on how install Python, just follow the steps below.

Anaconda is simply a software company that publishes a piece of software with a distribution of Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, and many other useful management tools.

Step 1: [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) for your operating system. If you do not know if you have a 32-bit or 64-it operating system, then Google how to find it. For Windows 10 users, press the Windows key, search "System Information", and look next to "System Type".

Step 2: Follow the installation guidelines, all of the default settings should not be a problem--you should not have to change any thing during the installation process.

Step 3: After the installation is complete, search for and run the "Anaconda Prompt". This is a replacement to your computer's normal command prompt--don't let the black box with a blinking cursor intimidate you.

Step 4: Type "python" and hit enter. If you installed Python/Anaconda appropriately, it should list the Python version (3.7.3), as well as some ancillary information.

**You're good to go!**
