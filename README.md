# Introduction to Data Analysis with Python

## Course Objectives
The goal of this short-course is to share programming knowledge and practical skills. The topics and problems covered are directly related to work I do as a data analyst. By the end of the course, you should be able to **open Python** and Jupyter Notebooks; **ingest data** from common formats such as Excel and CSV files, and relational databases, as well as cover more advanced techniques for data stored in PDFs, HTML, or Zip files; **wrangle data** using Python Pandas library as well as core built-in libraries; perform summary **analysis** and **visualizations**.

This course is designed for Python novices, but not necessarily novices in data analysis. The course will give you the Python skills to write "research code", not build software products--you are trying to prove a point or answer a question, not build software. I hope that through this course it will become clear how Python can be used to make many routine data analysis tasks easier--leaving you with time to do other things, like lift weights.

## Course Outline
Part I: Opening Notebooks, and the Data Analysis Pipeline  
Part II: Python Primer with Jupyter Notebooks  
Part III: Ingestion and Data Formats  
Part IV: Wrangling Data  
Part V: Analysis & Visualizations  
Part VI: Output and Sharing  

## Course Prerequisites: Installing Python with Anaconda
The course will work exclusive with Python 3 in Jupyter Notebooks, which can all be very easily downloaded from Anaconda. If you are a novice, and *especially for Windows users*, follow the steps below to get started with Python. Do not deviate from them or get hung up by the internet's many discussions on how install Python--trust me on this.

Anaconda is simply a company that publishes software that ships with a distribution of Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, and many other useful management tools.

Step 1: [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) for your operating system. Windows users: If you do not know if you have a 32-bit or 64-it operating system, then press the Windows key, search "System Information", and look next to "System Type" (or Google it).

Step 2: Follow the installation guidelines, all of the default settings should not be a problem--you should not have to change any thing during the installation process.

Step 3: After the installation is complete, search for and run the "Anaconda Prompt" (something similar is installed for MacOS). This is a replacement to your computer's normal command prompt (or shell)--don't let the black box with a blinking cursor intimidate you.

Step 4: Type "python" and hit enter. If you installed Python/Anaconda appropriately, it should list the Python version (3.7.3), as well as some ancillary information. If you see a line with ">>>", that's wonderful. If you're feeling ambitious, then type "2 + 2" and press enter.

**You're good to go!**

#### _My Pledge to You_
Python is a fighter jet when most of the time we want a hand-glider, making it an overwhelming tool to begin with. The biggest hurdle to using Python fluidly is that you _must know a little bit about how your computer works_, something those who design programs for your computer have worked tirelessly to help you avoid.

With that said, I will at times deliberately exchange thoroughness for practicality and decisiveness, which may offend an advanced user. However, _I promise to never lie to you_ and that _you will not need to unlearn skills picked up in this course_. Yes, you will always need to learn new tools or additional ways to perform a familiar task. Python is a gigantic ecosystem, but I won't let the intimidating vastness of the forest stop us from setting up a small camp among the trees.
